#Ingredients
an ingredient set or abstract ingredient set Q is:

##Sustainable
if nothing -> Q

##Depletable
if Q -> nothing

##Generatable
if nothing =X=> Q

##Consumable
if Q =X=> nothing

##Interchangeable
if Generatable and Consumable

##n-Combination
Sum of ingredients is at most a finite number n.
Recipes are possibly secret, with bad combinations often wasting ingredients.

##Compound
Multiple distinct ingredients, and a single output.

##Refinement
Multiple identical (homogenous) ingredients, with a smaller number of homogenous outputs.

##Snowball
When one of the outputs of a process is also capital for that process.
